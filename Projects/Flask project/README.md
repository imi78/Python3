<!-- This is a Python project for currency converter.
Framewoork is Flask.
Front-end is HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.
CSS is taken from internet with minor modifications made by me using Bootstrap.
The server that code is uploaded is returning an error which has to be resolved somehow, but the problem is not the code itself.
It's working like a charm locally.
