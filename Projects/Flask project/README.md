<!-- This is a Python project for currency converter.
Framework is Flask.
Front-end is HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.
CSS is taken from internet with minor modifications made by me using Bootstrap.
The server that code is uploaded to a free server and is returning an error which has to be resolved somehow, but the problem is not the code itself.
It's working like a charm locally.
